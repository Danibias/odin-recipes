    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pound boneless pork loin chops, pounded thin</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup Marsala wine, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Mix together flour, garlic powder, oregano, garlic salt, and salt in a medium bowl. Add pork chops and toss until well coated.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. <br>Cook pork chops in hot oil-butter mixture, turning occasionally, until brown on both sides. <br> Add mushrooms and garlic; cook and stir until mushrooms begin to soften and garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour in wine, scraping the skillet to loosen any brown bits of food on the bottom of the skillet. <br>Cover and simmer over medium heat until pork is tender and sauce is thickened, about 15 minutes. <br>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of pork should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). <br>If sauce is too thick, adjust by stirring in more wine, a little at a time.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
